# About Me

Hello my name is Adrian Beehner, I am a Senior Software Engineer with my primary experience in Full-Stack Web Development w/ .NET/Golang, Angular, Azure/GCP, and Kubernetes/Helm. I have my bachelor's in Computer Science from University of Idaho. I love anything to do with technology and mathematics, and desire to continue to learn and grow as a developer.

This online portfolio demonstrates the projects I have done for Technical Writings and projects I have worked from my University days, previous companies's projects (public facing), as well as personal projects.

These projects are in hopes to demonstrate my interests and passions in this field, Also I hope to display my eagerness to constantly learn and evolve my skills. The Technical Writings and Graphics projects show my skills at applying my knowledge to writing in a technical and professional style.
