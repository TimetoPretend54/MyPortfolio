## AWS Alexa - Alexa Interface w/ Baxter the Robot

Continuation of the University project revolving around having [Baxter the Robot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baxter_%28robot%29) make a cup of coffee.

The goal was for bidirectional communication between a custom [Alexa Skill](https://www.amazon.com/alexa-skills/b?node=13727921011) and the ROS Node for communicating with Baxter. [PubNub](https://www.pubnub.com/docs/sdks/python/) was used for the Pub/Sub Paradigm.
