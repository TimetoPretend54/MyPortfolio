<img src="../../assets/projects/PersonalProjects/BaxterAlexaProject/AlexaBaxterCoffeeFinal.gif" width="90%"/>

University project revolving around having [Baxter the Robot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baxter_%28robot%29) make a cup of coffee. Utilizing [ROS (Robot Operating System)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot_Operating_System) to help w/ 3D mapping, navigation, and real-time vision (OpenCV: Real-Time Computer Vision).

Alexa was for the desire of bidirectional communication between a custom [Alexa Skill](https://www.amazon.com/alexa-skills/b?node=13727921011) and the ROS Node for communicating with Baxter. [PubNub](https://www.pubnub.com/docs/sdks/python/) was used for the Pub/Sub Paradigm.
