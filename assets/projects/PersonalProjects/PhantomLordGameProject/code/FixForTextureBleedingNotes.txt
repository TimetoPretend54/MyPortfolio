Had to create my own verison of OrthogonalTiledMapRenderer, named it 
"OrthogonalTiledMapRendererBleedFix", it is in my "..core/src/com/badlogic/maps/tiled/renderers/"
folder, copy all the way from "com", put the copied "com" in your src folder for that project and
whenever you need to use OrthogonalTiledMapRendererBleedFix because of texture bleeding, make sure
to put "import com.badlogic.gdx.maps.tiled.renderers.OrthogonalTiledMapRendererBleedFix;" if need
to use this in another project/game, the issue I had was I didnt pad my tilesets, if you look at 
my tileset for phantomlord, they appear as a solid object, but they should have all have been in
some sort of "tiled" image look (where the padding would go), adding a method to 
OrthogonalTiledMapRendererBleedFix called fixBleeding and calling  that method at line 104 fixes
 the issue, so I didn't have to go and edit/pad my whole tileset!
